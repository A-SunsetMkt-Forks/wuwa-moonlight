## How to use üìÉ

### Github

### Discord

2. Download the injector I suggested.

## What's this? ü§î
- This is **free** DLC for Wuthering Waves. (I mean, it's an unofficial addition to the game that simplifies the gameplay)
- Earlier there were more functions here, but the author wanted to rewrite the project and so the functions will be added as updates are made.
